# Gander Social — Community User Guide

Welcome 👋  
This repository hosts the **community‑maintained user guide for Gander Social**.

The goal is simple:  
to keep clear, accurate, and up‑to‑date documentation that reflects how Gander Social actually works today.

This guide is written *with* the community, not just *for* it.

You do **not** need to be technical to contribute.

If something is wrong, unclear, or missing—please help us fix it.

## How to contribute (non‑technical friendly)

There are two easy ways to help.

### Option 1: Report an issue (fastest)
Use this if you notice:
- Incorrect information
- Missing content
- Confusing instructions
- Broken links or screenshots

Just open an **Issue** and describe the problem.

### Option 2: Suggest an edit
If you know what the fix should be:
- Open the page
- Click the ✏️ edit icon
- Make your change
- Submit it for review

A maintainer will take it from there.

More details are in **CONTRIBUTING.md**.

## Guidelines for contributions

A few simple rules keep this useful for everyone:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Write for clarity, not cleverness
- Describe how the product works *today*
- Avoid assumptions, opinions, or speculation

If you’re unsure, ask. We’d rather help than reject a contribution.

---

## Governance and moderation

This guide is community‑maintained, but not unmoderated.

- All changes are reviewed before publishing
- Content may be edited for clarity, tone, or accuracy
- Safety, privacy, and community standards take priority

If you have concerns about content or behavior, please raise them via Issues.
