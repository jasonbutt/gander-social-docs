## 🛰 INITIALIZING YOUR ACCOUNT

To join the Gander network, follow these steps as observed by the beta community:

1.  **Secure your Handle:** If you were on the early access list, check your transmission (email) for your unique registration link.
2.  **Verify Location:** Ensure your device recognizes your Canadian residency to access local-first content.
3.  **Sync with the AT Protocol:** Your Gander account is your key to the decentralized web. Keep your recovery codes safe—there is no "Central Command" to reset them if lost.

## 🏗 BUILDING YOUR NEST

In Gander, your "Nest" is your curated circle.

- **Follow with Intent:** Use the discovery tools to find creators and neighbors.
- **Flicks:** Engage with short-form video content without the dopamine-loop algorithms found on foreign platforms.
- **Boards:** Organize intel and posts into public or private collections.

## 🛡 PROTOCOLS FOR SAFETY

As beta users, we recommend:

- **Bias-Checks:** Utilize the built-in transparency tools to see the source of news links.
- **Troll-Hunting:** Use the community reporting tools to keep the network clean and constructive.
