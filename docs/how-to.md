# 🛠 FIELD MANEUVERS: INTERACTING WITH THE NEST

!!! danger "UNOFFICIAL BRIEFING"
Data based on Release 1.0.1 (109). This is community-observed intelligence.

## 📡 THE TRANSMISSION (POSTING)

When broadcasting to the Gander network, follow these community-established norms:

- **Signal vs. Noise:** Use context. A link without a briefing (commentary) is just noise.
- **Authorship Tags:** Always disclose if a post is **Human-made** or **AI-generated**. Transparency is the bedrock of our digital sovereignty.
- **The 300 Limit:** Keep your intel tight. URLs count toward your character limit.

## 📡 THE ENGAGEMENT STRIP

Every transmission (post) has a set of engagement controls at the bottom. Learn these early to move faster.

- **Like:** A lightweight signal of appreciation or agreement.
- **Comment:** Opens the conversation thread for direct dialogue.
- **Repost / Share:** Amplifies the intel to your own followers.
- **External Share:** Distributes the post to networks outside the Gander perimeter.

## 🗣 THE "TIM'S RULE" (CONVERSATION)

We maintain a "sharing space" rather than a "noise" space.

- **Context is Queen:** If you share a link, add a short briefing above it explaining why it matters.
- **Thread Hygiene:** When replying, aim to improve the thread rather than inflaming it.
- **Mentions (@):** Tagging other operators is an invitation to join the dialogue, not a summons for attention.

## 🔗 LINK PROTOCOLS

When you paste a URL, Gander generates a **Preview Card**.

- **Verify First:** If the source has a rating on `mediafactcheck.com`, check the context tags before amplifying.
- **Add Intelligence:** Don't just drop a link; explain why the community needs to see it.

## 🏗 LOGISTICS: BOARDS & FLICKS

Beyond the standard feed, Gander provides tools to organize and consume specific media types.

- **Boards:** Think of these as curated shelves on your profile. You can group related posts into themed collections.
- **Flicks:** High-speed vertical video content. Engagement here works similarly to standard posts, but optimized for a full-screen visual experience.
