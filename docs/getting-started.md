## ROTOCOL 01: VISUAL IDENTITY

Your profile is your "reconnaissance photo" for the community. Gander Social is currently a closed BETA, and recognizability builds trust faster than anonymity.

- **Profile Image:** Use a clear headshot or a clean brand logo if building a creator presence.
- **Display Name:** This is your readable name, not your handle. You can change this at any time to reflect your evolving voice.
- **The Bio:** You have up to 4000 characters. Use clear beats to signal your interests and help the right "flock" find you. Hyperlinks and emojis are permitted.

## PROTOCOL 02: THE HANDLE (@USERNAME)

This is your permanent identifier on the Gander network.

- **Consistency:** Keep it consistent with your other platforms if possible.
- **Permanence:** While you can change it, switching your @handle after building visibility can disrupt how people find and tag you.

## PROTOCOL 03: SECURITY & RECOVERY

- **The Recovery Anchor:** Ensure your email is current; it is your only way to recover access.
- **Data Portability:** Under Account Settings, you can find the **"Export my data"** tool. This supports the transparency and portability central to the AT Protocol.
