### 🛡️ THE PROTOCOL & PRIVACY

**Q: What is the "AT Protocol" I keep hearing about?** **A:** Think of it as the open-air frequency we all fly on. It’s the same decentralized foundation used by Bluesky. It means you own your identity and can move between servers without losing your "feathers" (followers/data).

**Q: Is my data actually staying in Canada?** **A:** Affirmative. Gander has partnered with ThinkOn (Toronto) for sovereign Canadian-based platform hosting. Unlike other platforms, your data doesn't take a "trip down south".
