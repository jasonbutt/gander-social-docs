### STATUS: Protecting the Nest

In the spirit of Gander, Newfoundland—where people opened their homes to strangers—this guide is about building a safer, kinder digital space. To keep the Gander Social platform resilient, all contributors (Operators) must fly in formation.

## Operational Directives

- **Fly Together:** We use the AT Protocol. Ensure your contributions respect open, decentralized standards.
- **Canadian Sovereignty:** Our data stays in the "Nest" (Canadian servers). Documentation must reflect our commitment to privacy and local context.
- **No Trolls in the V-Formation:** We build tools to spot bad actors. Your documentation should help users navigate safely.

## TRANSMITTING INTEL

1. **Scout the Area:** Check for existing Issues before starting a task.
2. **Submit your Report:** Use a Pull Request to merge your data into the main branch.

### VISUAL INTEL PROTOCOL

- All images must be placed in the `docs/images/` directory.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `login-screen-beta.png`).
