    **This is NOT an officially sanctioned Gander Social manual.**
    This hub is a civilian-led initiative produced by beta community members. While we aim for 100% accuracy in our intelligence, please refer to [GanderSocial.ca](https://gandersocial.ca) for official corporate communications.

> **"Social media that doesn't make you want to throw your phone into a lake."**

This is the central repository for all Gander Social community based operational data (really just a community managed guide). Whether you are a new user finding your wings or a veteran contributor helping us build the "Nest," you'll find everything you need here.

### :material-leaf-maple:Current Mission Parameters

Gander is currently in a closed beta, which means we aren't just users—we are the "Flock." Our job is to stress-test the Nest and help each other navigate the early days of the app and maybe help the "Flight-crew"(the hard working devs at Gander). The intent is to grow and update the User Guide as Gander grows and releases more features.

- **Observe & Report:** We are here to find the "Signal Drift." If a feature feels clunky or you find a bug, log it in the app's "Get Help". Click on the "Question mark" at the top right or, get this, shake your phone. Nice, eh! Your feedback directly helps the devs sharpen the platform.
- **Define the Culture:** We're the ones starting the "Honks." How we interact now sets the tone for the thousands who will join later. Aim for high signal, low noise.
- **Build the Guide:** Found a trick that makes the app easier to use? A shortcut for Boards? A better way to tag? Share it. We are building the manual for the next wave of the flock.

What else would you like to see in this guide? File a [**Report Signal Drift through Github**](https://github.com/jasonbutt/gander-social-docs/issues/new/choose) on Github and let us know. If you do not have a Github account you can submit via the Google form located here [**Report Signal Drift through Google Form**](https://forms.gle/aqf7NzzWMouooegt6).
Send a comments or suggestions through Gander (if we follow each other - or on BlueSky @jasonbu.online)
