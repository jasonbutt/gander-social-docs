**This is NOT an officially sanctioned Gander Social manual.**
This hub is a civilian-led initiative produced by beta community members. While we aim for 100% accuracy in our intelligence, please refer to [GanderSocial.ca](https://gandersocial.ca) for official corporate communications.

> **"Social media that doesn't make you want to throw your phone into a lake."**

This is the central repository for all Gander Social operational data (really just a community managed guide). Whether you are a new user finding your wings or a veteran contributor helping us build the "Nest," you'll find everything you need here.

### Current Mission Parameters

- **Privacy First:** No tracking. No surveillance. Just community.
- **The AT Protocol:** Building on open-source foundations.
- **Community-Led Intelligence:** Built by beta testers who want to see the "Nest" succeed. We aren't the devs, we're the boots on the ground.
