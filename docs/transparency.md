## :material-leaf-maple:MEDIA VERIFICATION

Gander is designed to combat misinformation by providing real-time context for external links. When you share a news article or website, the "Truth Transponder" automatically pulls data to help the flock assess the signal quality. When you post a link this way, the system checks the source against `mediafactcheck.com`.

### The Link Preview

When you paste a URL (like `https://cbc.ca`) into a new **Honk**, Gander generates a smart preview card with two critical verification markers:

* **Bias Rating:** A visual indicator of the source's political leanings (e.g., **CENTER-LEFT**). This helps the flock understand the likely perspective of the coverage.
* **Factuality Score:** A rating of the source's track record for accuracy (e.g., **HIGH FACTUALITY**). 

### How to deploy a varified link

1.  **Paste the URL:** Enter the web address directly into the post composer.
2.  **Activate the Preview:** Tap the **(+)** icon next to the URL input field to generate the verification card.
3.  **Review the Intel:** Before hitting **Post**, check the bias and factuality markers to ensure you are sharing a high-quality signal.
4.  **Add Context:** You can still add your own text and hashtags (like #News) above the link to provide your tactical perspective.

    The little **(i)** icon next to the factuality score provides a deeper dive into how the rating was determined. Gander uses independent third-party data to ensure these ratings remain neutral and objective.

!!! tip "TACTICAL TIP: SIGNAL VS. NOISE"
If a link generates a **LOW FACTUALITY** or **EXTREME BIAS** warning, it doesn't mean you can't post it—it just means the flock will see that metadata. This empowers everyone to make their own informed decisions about the intelligence being shared.
